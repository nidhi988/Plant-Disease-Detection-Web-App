# Plant-Disease-Detection-Web-App
In Keras and Tensorflow<br>
<br>

Setting up colab environment.<br>
Defining the plant disease detection model using keras. Later Converting the Keras Model to a Tensorflow.js compatible model.<br>
This is achieved using a Tensorflow.js converter module in Google colab which converts our saved model (from HDF5 or .h5 format) to a .json format which is compatible with any Javascript environment.<br>

This will create 5 output files <br>
group1-shard1of4.bin<br>
group1-shard2of4.bin<br>
group1-shard3of4.bin<br>
group1-shard4of4.bin<br>
model.json<br>

front end  is created using html and css.
